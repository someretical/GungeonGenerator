# GungeonGenerator

This project's aim is to recreate the level generator from Enter the Gungeon.

For details on how it works see [here](https://www.boristhebrave.com/2019/07/28/dungeon-generation-in-enter-the-gungeon/).

Instead of using GameObjects and bitmaps, the dungeon generated by this project will be in ASCII form.
